f5poolmgr installation


1. View and edit f5poolmgr.cfg
------------------------------

f5poolmgr reads in most of it's configuration directives through a flat text configruation file (f5poolmgr.cfg).  This file must be in the located in the base of f5poolmgr's application directory.

* Format is:

    $variable: "value"

* F5 use account:

    - $username and $password must correspond with a account on the F5 LTM.  This account should be set to the role of 'Application Editor' within the F5.
    - $server is the F5 device itself.

    - Example:

        $username: "f5poolmgr"
        $password: "1l0v3myltm!"
        $server: "bigip.company.com"
    
* LDAP authentication

    - $ldap.server, $ldap.base.people, and $ldap.base.group are all necessary for authentication.  $ldap.server your LDAP server, $ldap.base.people refers to the user base DN, $ldap.base.group refers to the group base DN.

    - Example:

        $ldap.server: "ldaps://ldap.company.com:636"
        $ldap.base.people: "ou=People,dc=company,dc=com"
        $ldap.base.group:"ou=Groups,dc=company,dc=com"

* Pool set-up

    - Pools access is defined by LDAP group membership.
    - A wildcard (*) grants access to ALL found pools.

    - Example:

        @pools.sysadm: "*"
        @pools.f5webcluster: "Server_cluster_pool_A Server_cluster_pool_B"


2. Apache set-up
----------------

Web set-up should be relatively simple.  Full Apache set-up is outside of the scope of this installation document.

* AuthLDAP is required for Apache set-up.

    - Example:

        <Directory /var/www/f5poolmgr>
            Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks

            AllowOverride None

            AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
            DirectoryIndex index.cgi

            AuthType Basic
            AuthName "f5poolmgr"

            AuthLDAPEnabled on
            AuthLDAPAuthoritative on
            AuthLDAPURL ldaps://ldap.company.com/dc=company,dc=com?uid

            Require valid-user

            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
